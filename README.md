# Chatbox

Chatbox is a web application that allows users to have conversations with an AI assistant in real-time. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter their messages and receive responses from the assistant. This README provides an overview of the code and instructions for running the application.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd chatbox`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the local development server: `npm start`
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).
3. The chatbox interface will be displayed with a greeting message from the assistant.
4. Type your message in the input field and press "Send" or press Enter to send the message.
5. The assistant will process the message and provide a response, which will be displayed in the chatbox.

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Messages are sent and received instantly without requiring a page refresh.
- Typing indicator: When the assistant is processing a message, a typing indicator is displayed to indicate that a response is being generated.
- User-friendly interface: The chatbox has a clean and intuitive interface for ease of use.

## API Integration

The chatbox integrates with an external API to handle the AI assistant's responses. The API used in this code is the RapidAPI ChatGPT API. To use the API, an API key is required, which can be obtained by signing up on the RapidAPI website. Once you have an API key, update the `X-RapidAPI-Key` and `X-RapidAPI-Host` headers in the code with your own API key and host.

Note: Make sure to follow the API provider's terms and conditions, and be aware of any usage limits or restrictions.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbox interface and styling by modifying the CSS file (`App.css`). Feel free to update the styles to match your desired design or branding.
